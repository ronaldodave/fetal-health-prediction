## Comparison of Machine Learning Methods to Predict Fetal Health Based on Cardiotocography (CTG) Data

Cardiotocography (CTG) is a tool that represents the Fetal Heart Rate (FHR) and Uterine Contractions (UC) of the fetal in the womb. FHR and UC values can be used as a reference in determining fetal health. Accurate prediction of fetal health from cardiotocography data is needed to reduce the number of maternal and child deaths due to complications. Therefore, machine learning with the type of supervised learning is used to accurately predict fetal health automatically. 
This report will present the results of designing and making prediction models using seven machine learning algorithms of supervised learning types including 
 - KNN-Classification 
 - Decision Tree-Classification
 - Random Forest-Classification, Naive Bayes Classification
 - Logistic Regression
 - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
 - Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
The seven models made will be compared to find the one with the best performance. The dataset used is the Cardiotocography Data Set obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. From the comparison of the seven models, the model made using Artificial Neural Network has the best performance in predicting fetal health with an accuracy score of 94.366%, precision of 91.915%, recall of 88.143%, and F-1 Score of 89.948%.
